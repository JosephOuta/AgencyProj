## Confirmatory Analyses 1

ANOVA and Ordinal Logistic Regression

### Two-way Mixed Effects Anova 

Since normality appears to be violated, we will conduct a two-way ANOVA anyway, then we will also conduct an ordinal logistic regression to see if results hold. NB: linear tests aren't as sensitive to normality assumptions as they are to homogeneity of variance assumptions. Our data appears to partially fail homogeneity test, so we might have to do an ordinal regression to see if pattern holds

Our two way mixed ANOVA has 3 null hypotheses:
- No difference in between-group variable (condition)
- No difference in within group variable (Sabotage)
- No interaction effect (condition:Sabotage)


```{r}
#==========#
two.way <- anova_test(
  data = dat, 
  dv = Behaviors, 
  wid = ResponseId,
  between = condition, within = Vignette
  )
get_anova_table(two.way) # There was a statistically significant main effect of condition F(1, 146) = 0.032, main effect of Sabotage on unethical behaviors F(2, 277) = 7.93, p = 0.0004, and main interaction effect F(2, 277) = 0.015. generalized effect sizes were low

#============ Post-Hoc Tests =============== ##

# Simple Main Effect of Condition at each vignette level
  ## Effect of condition at each vignettes
dat %>%
  group_by(Vignette) %>%
  anova_test(dv = Behaviors, wid = ResponseId, between = condition) %>%
  get_anova_table() %>%
  adjust_pvalue(method = "bonferroni") # Considering the Bonferroni adjusted p-value, the simple main effect of condition was significant at vign1 (p = 0.006) but not at vign2 (p = 0.88) and vign3 (p = 0.61).

  ## Pairwise comparisons between conditions

# Redoing the stats
## ANOVA

- Using aov_ez to capture unbalanced design and emmeans for post-hoc tests
```{r}


#============# summary()
#summary won't give us main effects and interaction effects. It gives us tests that we often do not need. 
#Summary is useful when we set contrasts. Instead use anova for main and int effects

#============# sums of squares()
#when using anova in unbalanced design, it makes a difference what kind of sums of squares you use. 
# type 1 sums of squares is rarely used (its sequential). anova() uses type 1 sums of squares by defaily. 
# type 2 sums of squares should not be used when theres an interaction
# type 3 aka partial sums of squares = use. Not sequential so order doesnt matter. This is default in literature, i.e. SPSS

#============#
lm(Behaviors ~ condition*Vignette, 
   data = dat,
   contrasts = list(condition = "contr.sum", 
                    Vignette = "contr.sum")) %>% 
  Anova(type = "3") #difference is we also have main effect of vignette compared to simple lm

#============#
fit = aov_ez(id = "ResponseId",
       dv = "Behaviors",
       data = dat,
       between = "condition",
       within = "Vignette")
fit$Anova #all significant = main 1, main 2, interaction

#============# same as aov_ez() 
mixed.anova.1 = lmer(Behaviors ~ condition + Vignette + condition*Vignette + 
                       (1|ResponseId), 
                     data = dat) #was not significant when added slopes for Vignettes
anova(mixed.anova.1)

#all pairwise comparisons with emmeans
mixed.anova.1 %>% 
  emmeans(pairwise ~ condition + Vignette,
          adjust = "bonferroni") %>% 
  pluck("contrasts")

#check model
mixed.anova.1 %>% 
  check_model() #many violations -> think about doing ordinal?

#check model matrix r is using to dummy code
model.matrix(mixed.anova.1) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  distinct()

#============# mixed() is literally lmer() then anova(lmer()) in 1 step
mixed.anova.2 = mixed(Behaviors ~ condition + Vignette + condition*Vignette + 
                      (1|ResponseId), 
                    data = dat) 
anova(mixed.anova.2) #still had to do anova to get results


```

## Permutation test
- Next, try to do a permutation test (see lecture on Simulation 2). Useful if conditions of underlying distribution such as normality are violated
```{r}

n_permutations = 500

func_permutations = function(df) {
  df %>% 
  mutate(condition2 = sample(condition)) %>% 
  group_by(condition2) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(Behaviors)) %>% 
  pull(mean) %>% 
  diff()
}

#run permutations using replicate rather than a forloop
df.permutations = tibble(
  permutations = 1:n_permutations,
  mean_difference = replicate(n = n_permutations, func_permutations(dat))
)

df.permutations %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mean_difference)) +
  geom_histogram()
  summarize(p_value = sum(mean_difference <= difference_actual)/n())

difference_actual <- dat %>% 
  group_by(condition) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(Behaviors)) %>% 
  pull(mean) %>% 
  diff()
  
  
```


## Brms ordinal regression

```{r}
dat3 <- dat %>%

fit.ordinal.complex <- brm(formula = bf(Behaviors ~ 1 + condition + (1 + condition|Vignette)) +
                     lf(0 + condition, cmc = FALSE), 
             data = dat3, 
             family = cumulative(link = "probit"),

                          data = dat, 
                          family = cumulative("probit")
                          )

             data = dat3, 
             family = acat("probit"))
```

### Assumptions of ANOVA

Since our DV is a Likert-scale, it is expected that this dataset will violate the assumptions of an ANOVA, since its highly likely that data will not be normally distributed. Below some standard tests were performed to see if our data meets assumptions of two-way ANOVA

```{r}
# Outlier check
dat %>%
  group_by(condition, Vignette) %>%
  identify_outliers(Behaviors) # Violated. 9 outliers, 2 of them are extreme

# Normality Check 1: Shapiro-Wilk test
dat %>%
  group_by(condition, Vignette) %>% # if Normal, p-values are greater than 0.05
  shapiro_test(Behaviors) # Violated. All p-values are very low meaning data is non-normal. 

# Normality Check 2: QQ-Plots (for sample sizes > 50)
dat %>%
  ggqqplot("Behaviors", ggtheme = theme_bw()) +
  facet_grid(condition ~ Vignette) # Violated. Non-normal behavior, since our DV is ordinal  

# Check for Homogeneity of Variance assumption of btn-subject factor (condition), at each within-subject level
dat %>%
  group_by(Vignette) %>%
  levene_test(Behaviors ~ condition) # there is HOV since Levene's p-values>0.05. All have similar variance

dat %>%
  group_by(condition) %>%
  levene_test(Behaviors ~ Vignette) 

# Check for Homogeneity of Covariances of between-subject factor (condition)
box_m(dat[, "Behaviors", drop = FALSE], dat$condition) # Box's M test p < 0.001 so unequal covariances

```


### Ordinal Logistic Regression 1

To preview the results of this OLR, significant results under the OLR generally match up with the ANOVA findings. Main effect of condition, Sabotage and interaction are all significant, though p-values for condition and Sabotage are less extreme under the OLR analysis, whereas the p-value for interaction effect is more extreme under the OLR.

```{r}



#1 - Main effect of condition
mod1 <- clmm(Behaviors ~ 1 + (1|ResponseId), data = dat3, link = "logit") #mixed cumulative link model
mod2 <- clmm(Behaviors ~ condition + (1|ResponseId), data = dat3, link = "logit")

#2 - Main effect of vignette
mod3 <- clmm(Behaviors ~ Vignette + (1|ResponseId), data = dat3, link = "logit")
anova(mod1, mod3) #p = 0.0058

             threshold = "equidistant")
Anova(mod4.test, type = "2")

             data = dat3, 
             threshold = "equidistant")

# Linear mixed effects regression
lin <- lmer(Behaviors~condition + Vignette + condition*Vignette + (1|ResponseId), data = dat)
anova(lin) #just to confirm ANOVA results = similar findings

### Three-way Mixed Effects Anova
