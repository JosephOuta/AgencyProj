# Assumptions of ANOVA

Since our DV is a Likert-scale, it is expected that this dataset will violate the assumptions of an ANOVA, since its highly likely that data will not be normally distributed. Below some standard tests were performed to see if our data meets assumptions of two-way ANOVA

```{r}
# Outlier check
dat %>%
  group_by(condition, Sabotage) %>%
  identify_outliers(Behaviors) # Violated. 9 outliers, two of which are extreme

# Normality Check 1: Shapiro-Wilk test
dat %>%
  group_by(condition, Sabotage) %>% # if Normal, p-values are greater than 0.05
  shapiro_test(Behaviors) # Violated. All p-values are very low meaning data is non-normal. 

# Normality Check 2: QQ-Plots (for sample sizes > 50)
dat %>%
  ggqqplot("Behaviors", ggtheme = theme_bw()) +
  facet_grid(condition ~ Sabotage) # Violated. Highly non-normal behavior - should be linear

# Check for Homogeneity of Variance assumption of btn-subject factor (condition), at each within-subject level
dat %>%
  group_by(Sabotage) %>%
  levene_test(Behaviors ~ condition) # there is HOV since Levene's p-values>0.05. All groups have similar variance

# Check for Homogeneity of Covariances of between-subject factor (condition)
box_m(dat[, "Behaviors", drop = FALSE], dat$condition) # Box's M test p = 0.09 which is > 0.001 so we have equal covariances

```

# Confirmatory Analyses

## Two-way Mixed Effects Anova


```{r}
res.aov <- anova_test(
  data = dat, dv = Behaviors, wid = ResponseId,
  between = condition, within = Sabotage
  )
get_anova_table(res.aov) # There was a statistically significant main effect of Sabotage on unethical behaviors F(2, 588) = 7.93, p = 0.0004, effect size of 0.006 (essentially no effect). Effect of condition was non-significant (p = 0.1) and interaction effect was non-significant as well (p = 0.1). Gen effect size was 0.006 (very low). 

#============ Post-Hoc Tests =============== ##

# Simple Main Effect of Condition at each Sabotage level
## Effect of condition at each sabotage
dat %>%
  group_by(Sabotage) %>%
  anova_test(dv = Behaviors, wid = ResponseId, between = condition) %>%
  get_anova_table() %>%
  adjust_pvalue(method = "bonferroni") # Considering the Bonferroni adjusted p-value, it can be seen that the simple main effect of condition was significant at sab1 (p = 0.042) but not at sab2 (p = 1) and sab3 (p = 0.9).

## Pairwise comparisons between conditions
dat %>%
  group_by(Sabotage) %>%
  pairwise_t_test(Behaviors ~ condition, p.adjust.method = "bonferroni") # Pairwise comparisons show that the mean Behaviors were significantly different in condition 1 vs condition 2 comparison at Sabotage 1(p = 0.0137); but not in condition 1 vs condition 2 at Sab 2 (p = 0.408) and at Sab 3 (p = 0.314).

### Simple Main effects of Sabotage variable 
# Effect of Sabotage at each level of condition
dat %>%
  group_by(condition) %>%
  anova_test(dv = Behaviors, wid = ResponseId, within = Sabotage) %>%
  get_anova_table() %>%
  adjust_pvalue(method = "bonferroni") # There was a statistically significant effect of Sabotage on mean Behaviors for both conditions, condition 1 (p = 0.018) and condition 2 (p = 0.03). 

# Pairwise comparisons between condition at each Sabotage levels - Paired t-test is used because we have repeated measures by Sabotage
dat %>%
  group_by(condition) %>%
  pairwise_t_test(
    Behaviors ~ Sabotage, paired = TRUE, 
    p.adjust.method = "bonferroni"
    ) %>%
  dplyr::select(-df, -statistic, -p) #removes details ## Using pairwise paired t-test comparisons, it can be seen that for condition 1, the mean Behaviors were statistically significantly different between Sabotage 1 and 2(p = 0.018) and between Sabotage 2 and 3 (0.027). For condition 2 the means were not significantly different between Sabotage 1 and 2 (0.897) and Sabotage 1 and 3 (p = 0.215), but they were significantly different between Sabotage 2 and 3 (p = 0.013)

#NB: two way mixed ANOVA ha 3 null hypotheses - no difference in btn group variable, no difference in within grp variable, and no interaction effect

```

## Linear mixed effects regression

```{r linear model}
# First just run linear model no mixed effects

dat_filt

lm_test <- lm(Behaviors ~ Sabotage, data = dat_filt)
summary(lm_test)

#plot 2
anova(lm(Behaviors ~ Sabotage, data = dat_filt))



# tutorial used: https://stat.ethz.ch/~meier/teaching/anova/random-and-mixed-effects-models.html#mixed-effects-models

mixed = lmer(Behaviors ~ Sabotage + (1 | condition), data = dat_filt)
summary(mixed)

## BIG ISSUE: I DONT KNOW HOW TO TELL WHICH IS FIXED EFFECTS AND WHICH ARE RANDOM EFFECTS

# we want a model that has a random effect per condition, and a random effect per combination of condition and Sabotage

options(contrasts = c("contr.treatment", "contr.poly"))

fit <- lmer(Behaviors ~ Sabotage + (1 | condition) + (1 | condition:Sabotage), data = dat_filt)
anova(fit) # Shows that the fixed effect of Sabotage is not significant. Fixed effect means the average Sabotage effect, where the average is taken over the two conditions. We know that every condition has its random deviation of this effect. Hence, the relevant question is whether the conditions just fluctuate around a constant Sabotage effect or whether the Sabotage effect is is substantially larger than this condition-specific Sabotage variation. Hence, this boils down to comparing the variation between different Sabotages (having 2 degrees of freedom) to the variation due to interaction between Sabotages and conditions (having 2 degrees of freedom (?))

#### Question: How to know whether my random effects (condition) are significant?

fit2 <- lmer(Behaviors ~ condition + Sabotage + (1 | ResponseId), data = dat_filt)
anova(fit2)

summary(fit2)


# for approximate confidence intervals
confint(fit, oldNames = FALSE)

## For residual analysis: Tukey-Anscombe plot:
plot(fit)

##QQ-plots
par(mfrow = c(1, 3))
qqnorm(ranef(fit)$condition[, 1], main = "Random effects of condition")
qqnorm(ranef(fit)$'condition:Sabotage'[, 1], main = "Random interaction")
qqnorm(resid(fit), main = "Residuals")


# Treating both as fixed effects
fit.fixed <- aov(Behaviors ~ Sabotage * condition, data = dat_filt)
summary(fit.fixed)

# effect of condition is much more significant


##MORE NOTES


# we assume there is a condition-level effect, but each sabotage is allowed to have its own random variation (?) hence Sabotage is random effects and Condition is fixed effects --- but not sure

```

## Ordinal Logistic Regression

```{r}

#what do I have

# 5 categories in DV
# 2 discrete predictors: condition and Sabotage



lapply(dat_filt_log[, c("Behaviors", "condition", "Kind", "Sabotage")], table)

d <- dplyr::select(dat_filt_log, -Kind)

# convert Behaviors to ordered factor using as.ordered


#Ordinal logistic regression is also known as proportion odds logistic regression

# use library(MASS)

## Google search shows there doesn't exist any non-parametric alternatives to 2-way ANOVA. Opinion is mixed but most seem to agree its still okay to do two-way ANOVA on Likert-type data like mine. See: https://journal.equinoxpub.com/JRDS/article/view/9482. So we will do ANOVA and then see if there are other alternatives. Looks like we could also do an ordinal logistic regression. 

# Another source has also indicated I can actually do an ANOVA despite my data being Likert type because 1) I have a valid zero-point in my DV, and 2) I have a valid constant separation between categories, so my variance is not meaningless. SOurce: look up "ANOVA for Likert type data". 


# some helpful links

# examine Skewness of data
hist(dat_filt$Behaviors)

library(moments)
skewness(dat_filt$Behaviors, na.rm = TRUE) # skewness coefficient of 1.23. Skewness of >1 means data is highly skewed

# What kind of transformation do I need
    # Well, one that treats dependent variable as one of 5 "ranks". 
    # Kruskal-Wallis and Friedman handle only 1 factor of N levels, so cant be used to examine interaction effects. 
    # Also my dv is ordinal; cant be transformed w/log transform: https://depts.washington.edu/acelab/proj/art/index.html
# looks like I need to do either an (ordinal?) linear mixed effects regression or an ordinal logistic regression or an ART ANOVA(Aligned Rank Transformed ANOVA)

# linear mixed effects then plot residuals. Look at Kurtosis. Will violate normality but doesnt matter
